Vole is an actor language that was designed for and influenced the design of an actor-specific virtual machine.  This started as a class project to create a virtual machine specifically for actor languages (some actor languages compile to the Java Virtual Machine, but the JVM is not specifically built to support the actor paradigm).  Since the Actor Virtual Machine is specialized, it provides a very efficient means of interpreting the Vole word code generated by the Vole compiler.
